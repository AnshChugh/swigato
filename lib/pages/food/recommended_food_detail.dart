    "Chicken marinated in a spiced yoghurt is placed in a large pot,then layered with fried onions(cheeky easy sub below!), fresh coriander/cilantre, then par boiled Indian basmati rice. The pot is then sealed with a tight fitting lid (or dough) and cooked on a low heat. This allows the chicken to cook in its own steam, the rice to cook in the chicken steam and the spices to infuse the rice. The result is a dish that is so fragrant and delicious, youâ€™ll want to eat it straight out of the pot! This is a simplified version of the traditional method which involves marinating the chicken overnight and cooking the rice separately.
